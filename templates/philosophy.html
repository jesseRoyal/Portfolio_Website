    <h1>Philosophy of Technology in Education</h1>
    <p class="author"><em>By Felicia Smith – 2nd Year Student, G.C. Foster College</em></p>

    <p>What is education without connection, curiosity, and creativity? In today's world, technology is like a river—constantly flowing, shaping the landscape of learning. But the question we must ask is: are we learning to swim with the current, or are we letting it carry us blindly?</p>

    <p>I believe technology, when used with intention, can be a bridge that links the traditional classroom to a world of endless possibilities. It opens doors to new ways of thinking, new ways of learning, and new ways of reaching each student where they are. With a tap or a click, students can explore the globe, watch history unfold, or even simulate science experiments. Isn't that incredible?</p>

    <p>Yet, even the most beautiful bridge can become dangerous if we forget where it leads. Technology, for all its wonders, also has shadows. Can we truly call it progress if it widens the gap between those who have access and those who don't? Can real learning take place if students are more focused on screens than on each other?</p>

    <p>To me, technology is a tool, not a teacher. It's the compass, not the journey. It can guide us, support us, and even inspire us—but it should never replace the heart of education: human connection, meaningful experiences, and critical thinking. There's magic in hands-on activities, in group discussions, in that "yaaay" moment that no app can truly replicate.</p>

    <p>So, how do we strike the balance? We use technology not because it's trending, but because it has a purpose. We choose digital tools that enhance—not distract—from learning. We blend the new with the old, the screen with the real, the tech with the talk.</p>

    <p>In the end, my philosophy is simple: use technology, but don't lose touch. As I grow into this profession, I will strive to be the kind of educator who embraces innovation while keeping both feet firmly planted in the values that truly matter—equity, engagement, and empathy.</p>
