    <p><strong>Education Technology Course Reflection</strong><br>
    <em>By Felicia Smith – G.C. Foster College</em></p>
    
    <p>When I started this course, I thought my prior experience with Information Technology would be enough to carry me through. I quickly learned otherwise. This course pushed me beyond basic tech familiarity. It demanded creative application, adaptability, and a willingness to step into the unfamiliar. The pace was fast, and having to learn new educational apps and produce engaging content within tight deadlines was overwhelming at times. Still, through trial, error, and a lot of perseverance, I found my rhythm.</p>

    <p>I’ve always believed education should spark curiosity, creativity, and connection, and technology, when used with purpose, can do just that. As I became more comfortable working on the computer, I learned how to make lessons more interactive, student-centered, and relevant to a generation that’s growing up with devices in hand.</p>

    <p>Teaching students about technology presents several challenges and disadvantages that educators must carefully manage. One major issue is access and equity; not all students have the same access to devices, reliable internet, or technological experience, which can create significant learning gaps. Another challenge is distraction, as technology can easily divert students’ attention away from learning tasks to unrelated activities like gaming or social media. There is also the risk of overreliance on technology, where students depend too heavily on digital tools and lose critical thinking or creativity skills, especially important in subjects like Physical Education.</p>

    <p>A major accomplishment has been applying the ISTE Standards to guide my practice. The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) is a global organization that provides standards for students, educators, and education leaders on the effective use of technology for learning. Their standards promote skills such as creativity, collaboration, problem-solving, and digital citizenship. In particular, I aligned my teaching with ISTE Standard 1: Learner and Standard 2: Leader, modeling continuous improvement and ethical technology use while empowering students to responsibly manage their digital interactions.</p>

    <p>Critiquing the course and tools, I recognize that while many technologies are available, not all are tailored to the dynamic and movement-based nature of PE. Some platforms lack adaptability for outdoor settings or rely heavily on constant internet connectivity, limiting their use in less-equipped schools. To improve, I recommend integrating more offline-compatible and mobile-friendly technologies that allow greater flexibility for active learning environments.</p>

    <p>Teaching digital citizenship has become an essential part of my role. I consistently model responsible tech use, openly discuss privacy and respectful online behavior, and encourage students to make thoughtful choices when using digital platforms — particularly when recording or sharing fitness activities. This aligns with ISTE’s emphasis on creating responsible, ethical users of technology.</p>

    <p>Overall, this journey has enhanced my technical skills and deepened my pedagogical philosophy: to foster active, informed, and digitally-literate learners. By continuing to reflect using the ISTE Standards, I am confident in my ability to manage and facilitate effective, technology-supported learning in Physical Education, while promoting digital citizenship among my students.</p>

    <p>One of the greatest challenges was balancing the technical requirements of each task with the creativity needed to make lessons meaningful. While I struggled initially, I began to see how these tools could bring my teaching philosophy to life. I've always believed education should spark curiosity, creativity, and connection, and technology, when used with purpose, can do just that. As I became more comfortable working on the computer, I learned how to make lessons more interactive, student-centered, and relevant to a generation that's growing up with devices in hand.</p>
    
    <p>Creating quizzes and instructional videos was by far my favorite part of the course. These tools allowed me to blend information and engagement, giving students a voice and a choice in how they learn. On the other hand, I truly disliked creating interactive PowerPoints. Though I understood their value, the process felt tedious and overly complex—hyperlinking slides, setting up triggers, embedding media—it was a lot of effort for something that didn't always function smoothly. It taught me patience, but it also reminded me that not every tech tool works for every teacher.</p>
    
    <p>Despite the challenges, this course was fun, engaging, and thought-provoking. Mrs. Walsh encouraged independence and problem-solving, often stepping back to let us figure things out for ourselves. That teaching approach—though frustrating at times—mirrored the kind of learning I want to inspire in my future classroom: discovery through doing. It also aligned with my belief that technology is a compass, not the destination. We must guide students with it, not lose them to it.</p>
    
    <p>In reflecting on this course, I see growth—not just in my digital skills, but in how I think about teaching in the modern world. I've come to understand that using technology in education isn't about keeping up with trends—it's about choosing tools that support meaningful learning experiences. As I continue to grow into the educator I want to be, I will use technology intentionally, creatively, and always with my students at the center of the experience.</p>
