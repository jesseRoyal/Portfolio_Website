    <p><strong>Education Technology Course Reflection</strong><br>
    By Felicia Smith – G.C. Foster College</p>
    
    <p>When I started this course, I thought my prior experience with Information Technology would be enough to carry me through. I quickly learned otherwise. This course pushed me beyond basic tech familiarity. It demanded creative application, adaptability, and a willingness to step into the unfamiliar. The pace was fast, and having to learn new educational apps and produce engaging content within tight deadlines was overwhelming at times. Still, through trial, error, and a lot of perseverance, I found my rhythm.</p>
    
    <p>One of the greatest challenges was balancing the technical requirements of each task with the creativity needed to make lessons meaningful. While I struggled initially, I began to see how these tools could bring my teaching philosophy to life. I've always believed education should spark curiosity, creativity, and connection and technology, when used with purpose, can do just that. As I became more comfortable working on the computer, I learned how to make lessons more interactive, student-centered, and relevant to a generation that's growing up with devices in hand.</p>
    
    <p>Creating quizzes and instructional videos was by far my favorite part of the course. These tools allowed me to blend information and engagement, giving students a voice and a choice in how they learn. On the other hand, I truly disliked creating interactive PowerPoints. Though I understood their value, the process felt tedious and overly complex hyperlinking slides, setting up triggers, embedding media—it was a lot of effort for something that didn't always function smoothly. It taught me patience, but it also reminded me that not every tech tool works for every teacher.</p>
    
    <p>Despite the challenges, this course was fun, engaging, and thought-provoking. Mrs. Walsh encouraged independence and problem-solving, often stepping back to let us figure things out for ourselves. That teaching approach—though frustrating at times—mirrored the kind of learning I want to inspire in my future classroom: discovery through doing. It also aligned with my belief that technology is a compass, not the destination. We must guide students with it, not lose them to it.</p>
    
    <p>In reflecting on this course, I see growth—not just in my digital skills, but in how I think about teaching in the modern world. I've come to understand that using technology in education isn't about keeping up with trends—it's about choosing tools that support meaningful learning experiences. As I continue to grow into the educator I want to be, I will use technology intentionally, creatively, and always with my students at the center of the experience.</p>
